# Elixir Advent of Code

This is a repo where I am hosting all the files with the code that I used to solve the [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com).

I went with Elixir as my language of choice to solve the challenge, while improving my skills and understanding of the language.

## How to use this repo?

1. Clone the repo.
2. Make sure you have Elixir v1.7.x and OTP 21.x.x installed.
2. Run the mix task according to the day and challenge you want to get the result of.

```
git clone https://github.com/JPYamamoto/advent_of_code
```
```
# To run the task of Day 01, Part 1:
mix d01.p1
```

## What is the Advent of Code?

The [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) is an annual event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

It is 25 days of December with two challenges per day, for you to solve using code.

You choose the language and the tools for you to complete the tasks!

It is an excellent idea for those developers interested in improving their skills through fun short problems to solve with code.

## What is Elixir?

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is a programming language that leverages the robust Erlang virtual machine, while providing developers with a good-looking syntax.

It is excellent at solving problems through the functional paradigm, allowing for concurrent, distributed, stable, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

## Thank you
- [Eric Wastl]() for creating the challenges for this event every year.
- [Mitchell Hanberg](https://twitter.com/mitchhanberg) for creating the project template for the Advent of Code in Elixir.
