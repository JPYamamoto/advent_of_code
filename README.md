# Elixir Advent of Code

This is a repo where I am hosting all the files with the code that I used to solve the [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com).

I went with Elixir as my language of choice to solve the challenge, while improving my skills and understanding of the language.

## What is the Advent of Code?

The [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) is an annual event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

It is 25 days of December with two challenges per day, for you to solve using code.

You choose the language and the tools for you to complete the tasks!

It is an excellent idea for those developers interested in improving their skills through fun short problems to solve with code.

## What is Elixir?

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is a programming language that leverages the robust Erlang virtual machine, while providing developers with a good-looking syntax.

It is excellent at solving problems through the functional paradigm, allowing for concurrent, distributed, stable, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

## Thank you
- [Eric Wastl]() for creating the challenges for this event every year.
- [Mitchell Hanberg](https://twitter.com/mitchhanberg) for creating the project template for the Advent of Code in Elixir.
